# Firebase Permissions Fix Guide

## üö® Problem: Permission Denied Error

You're seeing this error:
```
[code=permission-denied]: Missing or insufficient permissions
```

This happens because Firestore security rules are blocking access to the `calls` collection.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Update Firestore Security Rules

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Development Only)

For **development/testing only**, you can temporarily use permissive rules:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
4. Replace the rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This allows all authenticated users to access all data. Only use for development!

### Option 2: Production-Ready Rules (Recommended)

Use the secure rules I've created in `firestore.rules`:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
4. Copy the content from `firestore.rules` file in your project
5. Click **Publish**

These rules ensure:
- ‚úÖ Users can only access chats they participate in
- ‚úÖ Users can only access calls they are involved in
- ‚úÖ Proper message and signaling permissions
- ‚úÖ Security for production use

### Option 3: Firebase CLI Deployment

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (if not done)
firebase init

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üîß Additional Steps

### 1. Update Your Firebase Project ID

In `firebase.json`, replace `"your-project-id"` with your actual Firebase project ID.

### 2. Enable Firestore Collections

Make sure these collections exist in your Firestore:
- `users` - User profiles
- `chats` - Chat rooms
- `calls` - Call metadata
- `call-signaling` - WebRTC signaling data

### 3. Test the Fix

After updating the rules:
1. Refresh your browser
2. Try clicking a call button
3. Check browser console - the permission error should be gone

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still see permission errors:

1. **Check Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in with Google
2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check Rules**: Verify the rules were published in Firebase Console
4. **Check Console**: Look for other error messages in browser console

### Common Issues:

- **Rules not applied**: Wait 1-2 minutes after publishing rules
- **Wrong collection**: Make sure collection names match exactly
- **Auth issues**: Ensure user is properly authenticated before calling

## üìù Current Rule Summary

The security rules I created allow:

- **Users**: Read all users, write only own profile
- **Chats**: Access only chats you participate in
- **Messages**: Access messages in your chats only
- **Calls**: Access calls where you're caller or receiver
- **Signaling**: Access WebRTC signaling data for your calls

This provides security while enabling all chat and call functionality!

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Update Firestore security rules (choose Option 1 or 2 above)
2. Test the call functionality
3. The "permission denied" error should be resolved
4. Call system should work properly with authentication
