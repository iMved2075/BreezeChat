## üîç **Call Notification Debug Analysis**

Based on the debug logs, I can see the exact issue:

### **Current Problem:**
```
üéØ CallNotification render with props: {
  isVisible: false,        ‚Üê Should be true for incoming calls
  callType: 'voice',
  caller: null,            ‚Üê Should contain caller information  
  hasOnAccept: true,
  hasOnDecline: true,
  ringRemaining: 30
}
```

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The `CallNotification` component is working correctly, but it's not receiving the right data because:

1. **`hasIncomingCall` = false** (should be `true` when there's an incoming call)
2. **`caller` = null** (should contain caller information)

This means the issue is in the **Call Context** - specifically in the incoming call detection logic.

### **Missing Debug Logs:**
We're **NOT** seeing these expected logs from the call context:
```
üéØ Setting up incoming calls listener for user: [USER_ID]
üéØ Snapshot received, changes: [NUMBER]  
üéØ Incoming call detected: [CALL_DATA]
üéØ RECEIVE_CALL dispatched with payload: [PAYLOAD]
```

### **Likely Issues:**

#### 1. **Authentication Problem**
- The `currentUser` might be `null` or undefined
- User authentication might not be properly initialized

#### 2. **Firebase Listener Not Starting**  
- The `useEffect` for incoming calls might not be running
- Firebase query might be failing silently

#### 3. **Call Document Structure**
- Call documents might not match the expected structure
- Firebase security rules might be blocking reads

### **Testing Steps:**

#### Step 1: Check Authentication
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Current user:', window.currentUser); 
```

#### Step 2: Test Firebase Connection
- Go to `/test` ‚Üí Debug tab
- Click "Run Connectivity Test"
- Look for Firebase connection status

#### Step 3: Create Test Call
- Use "Test Call to Self" button
- Monitor console for incoming call logs

#### Step 4: Check Firebase Security Rules
- Verify that the `calls` collection allows read access
- Ensure user can query where `recipientId == user.uid`

### **Expected Fix Locations:**

1. **Authentication Issue**: `useAuth()` hook or Firebase auth initialization
2. **Listener Issue**: Call context `useEffect` for incoming calls  
3. **Security Rules**: Firebase Firestore security rules
4. **Query Issue**: The Firestore query structure or filters

### **Next Actions:**
1. Run the connectivity test in the debug tab
2. Check browser console for authentication errors
3. Verify Firebase security rules allow call queries
4. Test call creation and listener activation

The enhanced debugging will help pinpoint exactly where the chain breaks!
